            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hello! My name is Malik, and I am passionate about animes, the world of tech,i 
                really enjoy watching and playing football. I was born in the trenches of Lagos state specifically Ikorodu . Currently, 
                I still reside in Ikorodu. 
            </p>
            <p>I am a fresh law graduate,so I am sure you might be wondering why I decided to go into the field of tech that my friends is a story for another time. Over the years, 
            I have picked up certain hobbies such as playing football not that good but i 
            still enjoy doing it, writing my own form of poetry and playing video games.</p>

         <h3>Reason for Joining AltSchool</h3>
         <p>
            Basically I am supposed to go straight to Law school after i graduated,but we all know the world came
            to a stand still in the unforgettable years of 2019-2020 so basically the Nigerian Law School also took
            an indefinite break which resulted in a backlog. So i decided i could not stay at home without doing 
            anything so I decided that i amm going on an adventure by doing my NYSC and trying to learn new things.
        </p>

            <h3>Goals for Altschool</h3>
            <p> I feel as human beings we are all simple animals and as a simple man i wanted to become a frontend engineer.
                So i made my research came i  contact with NIIT, APTECH and some other institutions but then i saw a LayiWasabi skit 
               and then i got introduced to AltSchooland it was really the one for me at the time so i went with AltSchool and i can 
               tell you I am not regretting it.</p>
               <p>The main Goal is to make money meet new friends and get a whole new experience.</p>
